# DnD_Party_Manager_app

A Dungeon-Master (DM) needs an application to track their various players and their table-top gaming groups. This could become a gaming aid as well.


MVP

	- Be able to create a Character. Character information includes:
		○ Player
		○ Player contact details
		○ Character name
		○ Race
		○ Class
		○ Level
		
	- Be able to assign a Character to a Party.
	
	- Parties should have:
		○ Party Name
		○ Next Scheduled Game
		○ Number of Characters
		
	- CRUD actions for characters/parties

	- Prevent Characters from being added to more than one Party at a time.
	
	- Prevent duplicate characters being made with the same name.
	

EXTENSIONS

	- Allow players to have more than one Character across multiple Parties. Avoid repetition.
	
	- Give characters more detailed information; armour-class, passive-skills, damage types, languages, 
	  resistances, immunities, vision types, weights, exhaustion levels, auras, enmities etc.
	
	- Give the DM useful functions to manage their games:
		○ View all their upcoming game sessions
		○ Get player contact details for everyone in a session
		
	- In-game quick-reference tools to keep the game moving, without rummaging through character sheets or alerting players to surprises. 
	  DM should have easy access to check information for each character in a party. For example:
  
			§ Passive-skills checks (ie. What's the highest Perception score in your party? 
			  Should anyone have spotted the upcoming ambush?)
			§ Encounter-planning (ie. You have chosen a challenging enemy Dragon to put in their path, but is it a good choice? 
			  It should be quick and intuitive to check things like: What levels are your characters? 
			  Do enough of them have access to magical damage? 
			  Can any of them speak Draconic, and perhaps talk their way out of it?
			
	- Be able to mark a character as a non-player character and instead under the control of the DM. 
	  They should be quickly identifiable as such, but still included in other functionality.
